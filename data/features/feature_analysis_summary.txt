NOTEBOOK 02: FEATURE ENGINEERING SUMMARY
======================================================================

WHAT THIS NOTEBOOK DELIVERED:
  - Built a user-level feature matrix ready for modeling
  - Preserved interpretability while reducing product-level sparsity issues
  - Validated cross-notebook consistency for shared metrics

FEATURE MATRIX STATS:
  Users:           182,223
  Features:        149
  Missing values:  0
  Memory:          208.54 MB

FEATURE GROUPS:
  Aisle preferences:  135
  Reorder behavior:   3
  Temporal:           4
  Basket composition: 5
  Diversity:          3

KEY DECISIONS:
1) Low-variance aisle features: KEEP (let PCA downweight them)
2) High-correlation behavioral pairs: KEEP (complementary semantics)
3) Skewed distributions: no transform here; handle via scaling in Notebook 03
4) Outliers: KEEP (legitimate heavy-user behavior, not data errors)

READY FOR NOTEBOOK 03:
  - Apply StandardScaler
  - Run PCA (especially aisle block)
  - Combine reduced components with core behavioral features
  - Verify scaled matrix has no NaN/Inf

OUTPUTS:
  - feature_matrix.parquet
  - feature_descriptions.csv
  - feature_quality_report.csv
  - feature_analysis_summary.txt
